/// The other harnesses here cannot answer that, and the reason is structural rather than a
/// gap in their corpora. `simpsweep` samples real points, so a rewrite that is wrong only off
/// the real line never disagrees with anything; and it builds its expressions from a grammar
/// that never nests a function inside its own inverse, so that shape is outside its space
/// entirely. Four rules were wrong from 2020 to
/// https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues/884 with every harness green.
///
/// So this one is built the other way round: the shapes come from the *nodes* — every unary
/// function the library has, composed with every other, found by reflection so that a node
/// added later is covered without anyone remembering — and the points are chosen to sit
/// exactly where an assumption fails.
