    /// GenericTensor 1.0.4 keeps two process-wide mutable statics, and neither fails loudly.
    /// Reported upstream as https://github.com/asc-community/GenericTensor/issues/40 with a fix in
    /// https://github.com/asc-community/GenericTensor/pull/41; this type is what stands in until a
    /// release carrying that fix exists, and it should be deleted when one does.
    ///
    /// The two need opposite treatments, because only one of them can be closed without a lock:
    ///
    /// <b>The scratch-matrix pool</b> behind <c>DeterminantLaplace</c> and <c>Adjoint</c> hands
    /// every caller the same tensor for a given size, and the caller writes into it. There is
    /// nothing to warm and no way to avoid it from out here, so those calls take
    /// <see cref="ScratchPool"/>. Measured on GenericTensor's own suite, sixty 5x5 matrices
    /// computed sequentially and then again in parallel: 53 of 60 Laplace determinants and 60 of
    /// 60 adjugates came back with different values. Serialising them is the cost of not doing
    /// that.
    ///
    /// <b>The compiled-operation cache</b> behind the piecewise operators is an unsynchronised
    /// <c>Dictionary</c>, so it is only unsafe while it is being filled -- once an entry is there
    /// the reads are pure. That one needs no lock at all, because the set of entries this library
    /// can ever ask for is fixed and tiny: <see cref="Entity.Matrix"/> rejects any tensor that is
    /// not rank 2, and every call here uses the default single-threaded mode, so the only keys
    /// reachable are addition, subtraction and multiplication at rank 2. Filling all three once,
    /// under <see cref="Lazy{T}"/>, leaves the dictionary read-only from then on.
