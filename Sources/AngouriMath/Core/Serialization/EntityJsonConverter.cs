    /// Every node type carries it already (<c>Core/Serialization/Entity.Serialization.cs</c>), so
    /// an expression is serializable wherever it appears — a property, an array, a dictionary key
    /// — with no configuration. Adding an instance to
    /// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.Converters"/> is only needed to place it ahead of another
    /// converter for the same type.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// There is deliberately no second, structural, format. The printed form is already an exact
    /// serialization and it is the one the library has to keep exact anyway, since it is also the
    /// input format: parsing what <c>Stringize</c> prints gives back the expression printed, and
    /// <c>EveryNodeSurvivesEveryPipelineTest</c> enumerates the node types by reflection and fails
    /// the day a new one stops satisfying that. A structural schema would be a second contract
    /// over the same tree, with its own per-node code to keep in step and its own way of drifting
    /// from the first. What it would buy is speed — reading a 43-node expression costs about
    /// 430 us and 0.8 MB through the parser against 6 us and 25 kB to build the same tree from
    /// constructors — and that is an argument for a faster parser, which every caller who writes
    /// <c>Entity e = "..."</c> would also get, rather than for a second representation that only
    /// serialization uses.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// What the printed form does not carry, and neither therefore does this:
    /// <see cref="Entity.Codomain"/>, which no node prints, so a node narrowed with
    /// <see cref="Entity.WithCodomain(Domain)"/> comes back with the default
    /// (<a href="https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues/1022">#1022</a>); and an
    /// <see cref="Entity.Number.Complex"/> with both parts non-zero, which prints as a sum and
    /// reads back as one — the same number, a different node. Nor is a right nesting of an
    /// <em>associative</em> operator kept, since such an operand is not bracketed at its own
    /// precedence: <c>1 + (2 + 3)</c> comes back as <c>(1 + 2) + 3</c>, the same value written the
    /// other way round. Both are properties of printing rather than of this converter, and fixing
    /// them there fixes them here.
