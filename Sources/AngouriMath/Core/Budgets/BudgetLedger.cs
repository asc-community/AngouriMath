    /// <para>
    /// <b>Mutable, and single-flow, on purpose.</b> The limits are an immutable value so
    /// that they can be shared; the drawing-down is one object mutated in program order.
    /// The alternative — threading a remaining count through as an immutable value — has to
    /// <i>split</i> the count at every branch of a search, and there is no right split: an
    /// even one starves the branch that needed the work, giving it all to the first starves
    /// the rest, and a branch that fails then needs a protocol for handing back what it did
    /// not spend. A single ledger drawn down in program order needs none of that, is exactly
    /// reproducible as long as the algorithm's own order is defined — which
    /// <a href="https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues/746">#746</a>'s third
    /// design principle requires anyway — and bounds the search as a whole rather than each
    /// branch of it, which is the difference between a bound and a suggestion.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>A subgoal inherits the ledger rather than getting one.</b> Passing the same object
    /// down is what makes a call bounded end to end. Giving each stage a budget of its own
    /// bounds each stage and leaves the whole unbounded, which is how
    /// <a href="https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues/896">#896</a> arose:
    /// the same call is bounded or not depending on which internal path accepted it, and
    /// that is worse to debug than either extreme.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>Honouring is cooperative, so no thread is involved.</b> The algorithm asks —
    /// <see cref="Spend"/> before doing a unit of work, <see cref="Require"/> before letting
    /// a structure grow — and declines when told to. Nothing is interrupted, nothing is
    /// aborted, and there is no second thread to make the answer depend on scheduling. The
    /// cost is that an algorithm which does not ask cannot be bounded, which is the honest
    /// trade: a bound that is enforced from outside is a thread abort, and a thread abort in
    /// the middle of a rewrite leaves no answer worth having.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>The first ceiling to fire is the one reported.</b> Once one has, every subsequent
    /// question answers "no" without re-testing, so the reason cannot be overwritten by
    /// whatever the algorithm happened to ask next on its way out.
