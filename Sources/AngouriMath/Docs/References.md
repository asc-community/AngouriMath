The books, papers, corpora and libraries this code and its tests draw on, with what each is used
for. A citation in a comment, a test summary or a changelog entry names the work as it is named
here — *Sullivan and Mackey's Ex 5.3.2*, *Bronstein §2.2* — and this page carries the full title
and the link. Add a work here when it is first cited.

  The proofs book of [#1409](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues/1409): sets,
  subsets and power sets, indexed unions and intersections, the integer range `[n]`, quantified
  statements, congruences and residue classes, image and pre-image, injectivity and surjectivity,
  binomial identities, and induction — its examples and exercises are the rows of
  `QuantifierTest`, `SubsetTest`, `IndexedSetOperationTest`, `ImageAndPreImageTest`,
  `BinomialIdentityTest`, `InductionTest` and `ThresholdSetTest`.
