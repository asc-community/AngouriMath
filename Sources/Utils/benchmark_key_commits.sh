# Runs the inter-version CPU benchmark against every commit in key-commits.txt and writes one
# table of what it measured.
#
# https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues/529
#
# The benchmark that runs is always the one at HEAD, overlaid onto each checked-out commit, so
# that what differs between rows is the kernel rather than the question. #529 calls this
# "replaces the Program.cs".
#
# Each commit is checked out *whole* rather than just Sources/AngouriMath, which was tried first
# and does not work: the kernel's rule sets are produced by a source generator that lives
# elsewhere in the tree, so a kernel on its own is missing `Patterns.SortRulesArms` and will not
# compile. Measured, not guessed.
#
# A commit that will not build is reported as such rather than skipped. The benchmark at HEAD
# calls the public API as it is now, so an old enough commit genuinely cannot be measured this
# way, and that is worth seeing rather than silently omitting.
#
# What stopped older commits building was not that case, though. It was the *other* cases in the
# same project -- MatchingEngine reaches internals that were internal until v2.3.0, and
# TransformationLayer names Transformation.Rationalization, which did not exist at v2.1.0 -- so
# the project failed to compile and took the row with it while the case that runs would have
# compiled fine. `-p:InterVersionOnly=true` leaves those out. It is passed for every row, so the
# columns still compare: the same file is compiled and the same file runs in each of them.
#
# Run from anywhere.
