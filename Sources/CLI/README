This is free software. You're free to use, modify and redistribute it.

Why use it?
- Free and cross-platform
- CLI interface for script automations
- Piping for complex operations
- Fast and small

PIPING

    Any argument can be received either as a CLI argument or through
    standard input. For example,

        amcli eval "1 + 1"
    
    is equivalent to

        echo "1 + 1" | amcli eval

    This allows to pipe complex evaluations:

        echo "sin(x) * cos(y)" \     # 0. initial expression
        | amcli diff x \             # 1. differentiate over x
        | amcli sub x y \            # 2. substitute y instead of x
        | amcli diff y \             # 3. differentiate over y
        | amcli sub y "pi/3" \       # 4. substitute pi/3 instead of y
        | amcli simplify             # 5. simplify

    Prints

        -1/2 * sqrt(3)

    Special symbol "_" (underscore) can be used to use stdinput instead
    of an argument. For instance, if you want to substitute the result of
    an operation into another expression:
    
        echo "e^x" \
        | amcli sub u _ "u / (1 + u)" \
        | amcli sub x 10 \
        | amcli eval

    Here the result of `echo` is substituted instead of the second argument
    of `amcli sub`, not the last one.

COMMANDS

    EVAL

    amcli eval - to evaluate into a single number, boolean, or a+bi format 
    for complex numbers. Expects one argument.

    Example:
        $ amcli "1 / 2"
        0.5
        $ amcli "e ^ pi > pi ^ e"
        true

    DIFF

    amcli diff - to differentiate the expression over the given variable
    (the first argument). Expects two arguments.

    Example:
        $ amcli diff "x" "sin(x)"
        cos(x)
        $ amcli diff "x" "1 + x^2"
        2 * x
        $ echo "1 + x^2" | amcli diff "x"
        2 * x

    SIMPLIFY

    amcli simplify - to simplify the expression. Expects one argument.

    Example:
        $ amcli simplify "sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2"
        1

    SOLVE

    amcli solve - to solve a *statement* over the given variable. A 
    *statement* is an expression, otherwise evaluable to true or false
    (e. g. "x > 3" is a statement, but "x ^ 2" is not).

    When the solution set is a finite solution, all solutions are written 
    line-by-line. Otherwise, it's written as one line.

    Example:
        $ amcli solve "x" "x2 - 1 = 0"
        1
        -1
        $ amcli solve x "x2 > 1"
        (-oo; -1) \/ (1; +oo)

    LATEX

    amcli latex - to convert an expression into LaTeX format. Expects one
    argument.

    Example:
        $ amcli latex "1/2"
        \frac{1}{2}
        $ amcli latex "(sqrt(3) + x) / limit(sin(x) / x, x, 0)"
        \frac{\sqrt{3}+x}{\lim_{x\to 0} \left[\frac{\sin\left(x\right)}{x}\right]}

    SUB

    amcli sub - to substitute an expression instead of a variable. Expects
    three arguments (variable to substitute, expression to be substituted
    instead of the variable, expression).

    Example:
        $ amcli sub x pi "sin(x / 3)"
        sin(pi / 3)
        $ amcli sub x "pi / 3" "sin(x)"
        sin(pi / 3)

OTHER
    
    You can bind amcli to @ using aliases. On Unix-like operating systems,
    add
        
        alias @=amcli

    (or specify the full path)
