Any argument can be received either as a CLI argument or through
standard input. For example,

    amcli eval "1 + 1"

is equivalent to

    echo "1 + 1" | amcli eval


Possible options:

EVAL

amcli eval - to evaluate into a single number, boolean, or a+bi format 
for complex numbers. Expects one argument.

Example:
    $ amcli "1 / 2"
    0.5
    $ amcli "e ^ pi > pi ^ e"
    true

DIFF

amcli diff - to differentiate the expression over the given variable
(the first argument). Expects two arguments.

Example:
    $ amcli diff "x" "sin(x)"
    cos(x)
    $ amcli diff "x" "1 + x^2"
    2 * x
    $ echo "1 + x^2" | amcli diff "x"
    2 * x

SIMPLIFY

amcli simplify - to simplify the expression. Expects one argument.

Example:
    $ amcli simplify "sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2"
    1

SOLVE

amcli solve - to solve a *statement* over the given variable. A 
*statement* is an expression, otherwise evaluable to true or false
(e. g. "x > 3" is a statement, but "x ^ 2" is not).

When the solution set is a finite solution, all solutions are written 
line-by-line. Otherwise, it's written as one line.

Example:
    $ amcli solve "x" "x2 - 1 = 0"
    1
    -1
    $ amcli solve x "x2 > 1"
    (-oo; -1) \/ (1; +oo)

LATEX

amcli latex - to convert an expression into LaTeX format. Expects one
argument.

Example:
    $ amcli latex "1/2"
    \frac{1}{2}
    $ amcli latex "(sqrt(3) + x) / limit(sin(x) / x, x, 0)"
    \frac{\sqrt{3}+x}{\lim_{x\to 0} \left[\frac{\sin\left(x\right)}{x}\right]}
